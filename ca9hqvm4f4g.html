If holes are created and are big enough, dextran molecules will enter the microalgae and fluorescence will be measured. Acquisition is performed on a confocal microscope. Single plane is acquired (at the center of the microalgae).</div><div>We acquire different channel : Dextran (green fluorescence), Membrane (tagged in yellow fluorescence XXX),     Chlorophyll     (Autofluorescence in red), visible channel (for visualization of microalgae integrity).</div><div></div>

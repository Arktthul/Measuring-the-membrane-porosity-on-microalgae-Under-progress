These are the indexes of the donnut new ROIS.</div><div>The last ROI is the central area of each microalgae, its index is 9+ROIcount.</div><div>We create a newArray called IntensityArray in which intensity of each Rois will be stored. This new result table is&nbsp; called ResultsofsingleMicroAlgae+i (index of the microalgae).&nbsp; Here we are closing it as the number of created tables will be too much to handle properly.</div>

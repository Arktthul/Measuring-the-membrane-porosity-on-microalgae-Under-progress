Creation of concentric rings</h3><div></div><div>Different methods can be applied to create concentric rings.&nbsp; Constant radius displacement, constant areas. This twienno can be also normalised by the size of the microalgae.</div><div>Each one can be interesting and supported by different diffusion models : free diffusion, viscosity model and depends of primay knowledge on the organism.</div><div></div><div>We approximate the microalgae as a circle for which the radius can retrived by measuring the area. We compute a variable Diff that will be depending on the circle number.</div><div>We decided to realise ten concentric rings for which each donut new Rois will have the same approximative area.

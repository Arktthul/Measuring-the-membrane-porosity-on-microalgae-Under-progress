<div>Cinquin, Bensalem</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction :&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;Seen as microfactories, microalgaes are organisms of prime interests. Howewer, the molecules of interests they're making are enclosed and so far the only way of releasing is done by killing the biomass, filtering and extracting the molecule. Working on membrane porosity is challenging and could help finding a "clean way" of producing such molecules. Controlled electroporation could be a way. Previous experiments shows that there is a voltage dependency to form non permanent holes in the membrane.&nbsp; This reversible damage is</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>

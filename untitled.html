<div>Cinquin, Bensalem</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction :&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>Seen as microfactories, microalgaes are organisms of prime interests. Howewer, the molecules of interests they're making are enclosed and so far the only way of releasing is done by killing the biomass, filtering and extracting the molecule. Working on membrane porosity is challenging and could help finding a "clean way" of producing such molecules. Controlled electroporation could be a way. Previous experiments shows that there is a voltage dependency to form non permanent holes in the membrane.&nbsp; This reversible damage will allow the escape of some molecules and the repair by the microalgae to take place. Howewer, measuring the effects on electroparation different parameters is challenging.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>The experiment :&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;Microalgae are electropored and bathed into a fluorescent dextran solution of different molecular weight. If holes are created and are big enough, dextran molecules will enter the microalgae and fluorescence will be measured. Acquisition is performed on a confocal microscope. Single plane is acquired (at the center of the microalgae).</div><div>We acquire different channel : Dextran (green fluorescence), Membrane (tagged in yellow fluorescence XXX), Chlorophylle (Autofluorescence in red), visible channel (for visualization of microalgae integrity).</div><div>We will use the Membrane channel to segment the microalgaes, report the mask on the Dextran channel and realise concentr</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>

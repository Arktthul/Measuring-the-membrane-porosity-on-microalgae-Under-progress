<div>To create the donnut shape ROI, we will select two consecutive circles and use XOR logical operator, the new shape will be added to the Roimanager.</div><div>Theoretically  ,&nbsp; it should work but the number of pixels is finite. The computation work in a continuous space but not in a discrete one. That means that Diff can be 0 or round up to 0 because the microalgae is too small to begin with. In this case, the new created circle will be the same as the previous one. By consequence, XOR of two same ROIS is void and no new ROI can be created. If we force the creation of a R</div>
